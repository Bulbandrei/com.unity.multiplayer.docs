title: Your First Networked Game "Hello World"
description: Tutorial that explains creating a project, installing the  Netcode for GameObjects package, and creating the basic components for your first networked game.
---

A **Hello World** program is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Normally, it is  the first program written by people learning to code. It is also used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.

This "Hello World" tutorial walks you through creating a project, installing the  Netcode for GameObjects (Netcode) package, and creating the basic components for your first networked game.

## Requirements

This tutorial requires an Netcode-supported version of Unity (2019.4+).


## Create a new project in Unity

1. Open the **Unity Hub**
1. Click **New** 
1. Select type **3D**
1. Rename the project `Hello World`
1. Select the location to save the project

## Import Netcode Package via URL

See the [Install Netcode](../../migration/installation.md) guide to install the Netcode package.

## The Basic Components of Netcode

The following sections guide you through the basic components of Netcode:
* The Network Manager and Transport
* Objecting spawning for your players
* Testing your project

The [second part](helloworldparttwo.md) of the **Hello World** tutorial will build on these components.

### Creating a Network Manager and selecting a Transport

1. Right-click in the **Hierarchy** tab of your Unity Project Window.
1. Select **Create Empty**.
1. Rename the `GameObject` **NetworkManager**.
   
  :::note
  We renamed the `GameObject` because:
    * It makes it  easier to refer to later.
    * There should only be one **NetworkManager** object that contains the  `NetworkManager` component. You may get unexpected results if you create more than one **NetworkManager**.
  :::

You have created a new `GameObject` called **NetworkManager**. Now we will add the `NetworkManager` component and select the transport type.

1. Select **NetworkManager**.
1. Click **Add Component** in the **Inspector** tab.
1. Select **MLAPI** from the list.
1. Select `NetworkManager` component.
1. Inside the `NetworkManager` component tab, locate the  `NetworkTransport` field. It may have a warning icon stating that a transport is required for Netcode to work. 
1. From the **Select Transport...** dropdown, select `UnetTransport`.
1. Save your scene.

## Creating an object to spawn for each connected player

This section adds in a player object and spawns it for each connected player.

1. Right-click in the **Hierarchy** tab of your Unity Project Window.
2. Select **3D Object** > **Capsule**, and rename it **Player**.
3. Add a `NetworkObject` component by clicking **Add Component** in the **Inspector** tab, select **MLAPI**, then **NetworkObject**.
4. From the **Projects** tab, right-click the **Assets** folder, hover over **Create**, and select **Folder**. Name this folder **Prefabs**.
5. Drag your recently created **Player** object to your new **Prefabs** folder. This makes the **Player** object a [prefab](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html).
6. Right-click and delete **Player** from the scene.

  :::tip
  We remove **Player**, because we will be using the built-in functionality of the NetworkManager to spawn the player. Doing so will make the NetworkManager spawn a player object for each connecting client and automatically give that client ownership over their player object.

  If you do not remove **Player**, a player object will exist at scene load that doesn't react with the NetworkManager.
  :::
1. Select your `NetworkManager` object from the **Hierarchy** tab.
2. Go to the **Inspector** tab > **NetworkManager** component > **NetworkPrefabs**. 
3. Click `+` to create a slot.
4. Drag the **Player** prefab from **Assets** > **Prefabs** to the new empty slot, and select the **Default Player Prefab** checkbox. You may need to expand your project window to see the **Prefab** space.

  :::important
  When you select the **Default Player Prefab** checkbox, you are telling the library that when a client connects to the game, automatically spawn this prefab as the character for the connecting client. If you do not have any prefab set as `Default Player Prefab`, the game will crash on client connect.
  :::

  :::note
   You may see the following error on your **Console** tab: `There is no NetworkPrefab Marked as a PlayerPrefab`.
   
   Once you have completed the above steps, you can **Clear** the error.
  :::
5. Finish this section by right-clicking in the **Hierarchy** tab, hover over **3D Object**, select **Plane**.
6. Save your scene.

### Testing Hello World

Now we will test to see if everything works as expected.

1. Click **Play**. A **DontDestroyOnLoad** scene will appear on the **Hierarchy** tab.
1. Select the **NetworkManager** object under **DontDestroyOnLoad**. Then click **Start Host** under **NetworkManager** component on the **Inspector** tab. A **Player(Clone)** object will appear under your sample scene on the **Hierarchy** tab.

:::note Congrats!
Congratulations, you have created a networked game. It is not a very flashy game but it is a networked game nonetheless. For the next steps in your journey see [Building on "Hello World"](helloworldparttwo.md)
