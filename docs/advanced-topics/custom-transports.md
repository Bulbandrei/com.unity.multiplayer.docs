title: Unity and Custom Transports
description: Learn more about Unity Transports for MLAPI, collecting messages from applications and transmitting them across the network. MLAPI supports default and custom transports.
---

Netcode for GameObjects (Netcode) uses Unityâ€™s [UNet Transport Layer API ](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNetUsingTransport.html) by default and has support for custom Transports. 

A Transport collects messages from the application and transmits them over the network. The Transport layer is also responsible for making sure that all packets arrive and in order if needed. Transports ensure your data's integrity, keeping it from being corrupted when it is sent over the network.

## NetworkTransport

Netcode supports community contributions for Transport implementations. See the [Netcode Community Contributions](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/mlapi-community-contributions)  repository to learn more.

To use a Transport, follow the [Community Transport Installation Guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/mlapi-community-contributions/tree/master/Transports).

## Contributing implementations

To get started writing Transport interfaces, the current implementations for UNet Transport Layer API, ENET, and Ruffles are good starting points for learning their flow. If you write a wrapper for a well-known Transport, please open a PR to add it to the [Netcode Contribution repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/mlapi-community-contributions).
